This container is for Microsoft Teams, the progressive web app.

First install the progressive web app by running

  ./install.sh

Log in to your organization's Teams instance, and then select the 'Install'
icon to the right in the address bar. This opens a new separate Teams window.
Once it has finished loading, close it and the original Google Chrome instance.
